# ENAE788Z---Final-Project
A final project for ENAE788Z: Decision-Making under Uncertainty at the University of Maryland, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. 

The goal of this work was to apply to methods from the class to a novel problem, culimating in a report and presentation. In this project, I applied a reinforcement-learning strategy to optimally learning traffic signalling at a four-way intersection. The project culimated in an 8-page IEEE-style report titled "Reinforcement Learning of a Four-Way Traffic Signal System"
